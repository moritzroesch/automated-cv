# Generating personal datadriven CV in R

This repo contains my personal datadriven CV. The CV is constructed by the [`datadrivencv` package] (https://github.com/nstrayer/datadrivencv) developed by Nick Strayer. The `datadrivencv` functions allow to populated the CV with the data stored in an external Googlesheet on my Google Drive. The CV is then rendered using `RMarkdown` and `pagedown` packages.
